This is now a fork of libxm, with some tweaks to make the build system 
simpler. The differences include:

- Using vanilla Makefiles instead of CMake
- Moving away from C99/C11 extensions
- Moving towards ANSI-compliant code (we'll see how this one goes). 
- An implementation of libxm as an extern Sporth Unit Generator


libxm
=====

A small XM (FastTracker II Extended Module) player library. Designed
for easy integration in demos and such, and provides timing functions
for easy sync against specific instruments, samples or channels.

Written in C11 and released under the WTFPL license, version 2.

Examples
========

Three example programs are provided.

* `xmtoalsa` is a simple player that uses the ALSA library. It
  produces `xmp`-like output while playing. Use `xmtoalsa --help` (or
  check the source) to see the full usage.

  ~~~
  ./xmtoalsa --random **/*.xm
  ~~~

* `xmtowav` will play a module and output a `.wav` file.

  ~~~
  ./xmtowav my_module.xm my_module.wav
  mplayer my_module.wav # Or use cvlc, mpg123, etcâ€¦
  ~~~

* `xmtoau` will play a module and output a `.au` file to standard
  output.

  ~~~
  ./xmtoau my_module.xm | play -

  # Alternative (trancode to Opus using ffmpeg+libopus)
  ./xmtoau my_module.xm | ffmpeg -i - -c:a libopus my_module.opus
  mplayer my_module.opus

  # Alternative (trancode to MP3 using ffmpeg+lame)
  ./xmtoau my_module.xm | ffmpeg -i - -c:a libmp3lame -q:a 0 my_module.mp3
  mplayer my_module.mp3
  ~~~

* `xmbench` is a benchmark program.

Here are some interesting modules, most showcase unusual or advanced
tracking techniques (and thus are a good indicator of a player's
accuracy):

* [Cerror - Expatarimental](http://modarchive.org/module.php?136603)
* [Lamb - Among the stars](http://modarchive.org/module.php?165819)
* [Raina - Cyberculosis](http://modarchive.org/module.php?165308)
* [Raina - Slumberjack](http://modarchive.org/module.php?148721)
* [Strobe - One for all](http://modarchive.org/module.php?161246)
* [Strobe - Paralysicical death](http://modarchive.org/module.php?65817)

Known issues
------------

* Only loads FastTracker II-compatible XM files.

* Loading a bogus file (that yet has a valid 60-byte header) will
  probably result in a segmentation fault.

* Big endian architectures are not yet supported.

Tests
=====

Some test XM files are in the `tests` directory. Their goal is to test
a certain feature against regressions. A summary of tests (and what
they are supposed to test) is in the table below.
